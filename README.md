This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
Iâ€™m a UX researcher with a background in psychology, which gives me a unique perspective on understanding user behaviors and motivations. My experience in psychology allows me to dive deeper into the cognitive and emotional factors that shape how people interact with products. I leverage this expertise to conduct thorough research, gather meaningful insights, and ensure that the designs we create are truly user-centered.
